Just a few sample C++ code that I use for reserach. 

I've implemented a dynamic tracking implementation of shortest paths on a time series of point clouds. 

A dynamic programming implementation was used because my graph edge weights need to be recomputed based on different initial conditions. 

In the future, can test with a more traditional BFS or DFS implementation.
